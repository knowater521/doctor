DocTor -- A service that periodically checks the Tor network
          for consensus conflicts and other hiccups
============================================================

DocTor is a Java application that downloads the Tor consensus and votes
from the Tor directory authorities and checks them for consensus problems.

DocTor writes its findings to local files which can then be sent to a
mailing list or IRC bot, or which can be served by an HTTP server.
