DocTor -- A service that periodically checks the Tor network
          for consensus conflicts and other hiccups
============================================================

DocTor is a Java application that downloads the Tor consensus and votes
from the Tor directory authorities and checks them for consensus problems.

DocTor writes its findings to local files which can then be sent to a
mailing list or IRC bot, or which can be served by an HTTP server.


Howto
-----

Create a lib/ directory.

Download Apache Commons Codec 1.4 or higher and put it in the lib/
directory.  If the filename is not commons-codec-1.4.jar, update the
build.xml file.

Clone metrics-lib, create a .jar file using `ant jar`, and put it in the
lib/ directory, too.

Compile the Java classes using `ant compile`.

Run the application using `ant run`.

Output files are:

 - out/status/new-warnings: Consensus warnings that have been found in
   this execution or that were found long enough before to not be
   rate-limited anymore.

 - out/status/all-warnings: All warnings found in this execution, but only
   if at least one of them is in new-warnings, too.

 - out/website/consensus-health.html: HTML file containing a full
   comparison of consensuses to its votes, marking problems in red.

Generated temp files (read: don't mess with them) are:

 - out/stats/download-stats.csv: Raw consensus download times.

 - out/stats/last-warned: Warning messages and when they were last
   contained in new-warnings or all-warnings.
